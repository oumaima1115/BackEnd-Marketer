          "postDescription": "Honey, I compacted the Al model.\r\n\r\nResearchers at Microsoft were able to train an LLM with model weights stored in a format that is a heck of a lot smaller than current LLMs while still achieving the same quality.\r\n\r\nThey built on the BitNet work from MSFT last year that represented parameters in binary (aka Os and 1s) instead of FP and added a third option (aka -1, 0, 1) for a little more detail...without losing any speed...and still gaining some performance. Wow.\r\n\r\n\"The 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective,\" says the paper.\r\n\r\nTheir 3B model uses 3.5x less memory while running 2.7x faster than an equivalent Llama model.\r\n\r\nSo what does this mean? Model size and cost have been barriers to entry for LLMs, but we may see models run more efficiently on cheaper GPUs or make extremely scaled LLMs without increasing the cost or complexity of hosting.\r\n\r\nThis may also reduce hardware demands and energy consumption, so we may be seeing a more sustainable future for Al.\r\n\r\n*I'm not an eng, I read these for fun/my job, ping an MLE with questions\r\n\r\nRead more ðŸ‘‰\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nReminder: Iâ€™m hosting a 30min, free lightning lesson THIS Friday at 12pm ET on AI and productivity.
