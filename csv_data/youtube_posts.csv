youtube,Blind Surfer Pete Gustin,123456,"I don’t think I can properly convey the complete and total amount of fear that tries to overtake me every time I start to paddle out into a rough sea.  Without sight, it’s just a complete and total overtaking all of my senses and all I can rely on is my own body and mind to pull me through the terror so that I can come out on the other side and start enjoying the sport of surfing.  why do I do it if it’s so dam n scary?  I do it because I absolutely LOVE the surfing part of surfing and I’m not going to let the petrifying part of getting out there blind prevent me from experiencing that joy.

youtube,World Surf League,123456,"Since it hosted the first Championship Tour event ever in 1976, Sunset Beach has long stood as an old-school test of power surfing. And while timeless rail-to-rail surfing still dominates, a new school of surfers is beginning to redefine the wave with a more modern approach. Who will win out, and who heads to colder waters on a hot streak?
